<h1>About me</h1>
<h2>My name is Burak and I am learning to code in Django right now. Of course, you'll need
to get along with different programming languages, so this all happens in HTML right now.
I'm looking forward for the other websites that I'll eventually build and hope, that I'll continue to pursue
programming!</h2>
